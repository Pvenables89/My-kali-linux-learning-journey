# My-kali-linux-learning-journey - day 1 - 23rd August 2025

step by step documentation of where i am coming from to learn hacking and build my brand all this was due to a man selling me  a piratedcopy of windows 1 on the lapyop that i invested the last of my finances on.

## Todays challenge was that i had to download kali linux then make it into a bootable usb the first time this failed due to a suspected bad formatting so after that i went into terminal and followed Diskpart - list disk - select disk x then (I NEED TO ENTER THE FINAL FEW STEPS)

The usb ran after being formatted via termial and i could install kali with no issues at all.

now i am going to attempt a quick network map of my home network using nmap but i will also try as advised and use certain tools in conjuction and whatch what happens
